# Installing and Running a Node

UPDATED FOR TAG: 1.14.2

## PREREQUISITES

Set up your platform:

You will need:

* An x86 host (AMD or Intel), Virtual Machine or AWS instance with at least 2 cores, 4GB of RAM and at least 10GB of free disk space;
* A recent version of Linux, not Windows or MacOS â€“ this will help us isolate any issues that arise;
* Make sure you are on a network that is not firewalled. In particular, we will be using TCP/IP port 3000 and 3001 by default to establish connections with other nodes, so this will need to be open.
* You can follow this [SERVER TUTORIAL](000_AWS.md) to get the server up and running.

## Install dependencies

We need the following packages and tools on our Linux system to download the source code and build it:
    - the version control system ``git``,
    - the ``gcc`` C-compiler,
    - C++ support for ``gcc``,
    - developer libraries for the the arbitrary precision library ``gmp``,
    - developer libraries for the compression library ``zlib``,
    - developer libraries for ``systemd``,
    - developer libraries for ``ncurses``,
    - ``ncurses`` compatibility libraries,
    - the Haskell build tool ``cabal``,
    - the GHC Haskell compiler.

If we are using an AWS instance running Amazon Linux AMI 2 (see the [AWS walk-through](000_AWS.md) for how to get such an instance up and running)or another CentOS/RHEL based system, we can install these dependencies as follows:

    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum install git gcc gcc-c++ tmux gmp-devel make tar wget zlib-devel libtool autoconf -y
    sudo yum install systemd-devel ncurses-devel ncurses-compat-libs -y

For Debian/Ubuntu use the following instead:


    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libffi-dev libgmp-dev libssl-dev libtinfo-dev libsystemd-dev zlib1g-dev make g++ tmux git jq wget libncursesw5 libtool autoconf -y

If you are using a different flavor of Linux, you will need to use the package manager suitable for your platform instead of `yum` or `apt-get`, and the names of the packages you need to install might differ.

Download, unpack, install and update Cabal:

    wget https://downloads.haskell.org/~cabal/cabal-install-3.2.0.0/cabal-install-3.2.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux.tar.xz
    tar -xf cabal-install-3.2.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux.tar.xz
    rm cabal-install-3.2.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux.tar.xz cabal.sig
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
    mv cabal ~/.local/bin/


This will work on a fresh [AWS instance](000_AWS.md) and assumes that folder `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`.
On other systems, you must either move the executable to a folder that is in your `PATH` or modify your `PATH` by adding the line

    export PATH="~/.local/bin:$PATH"

to your `.bashrc`-file.

## Adding ~/.local/bin and ~/.cabal/bin to the PATH

Navigate to your home folder:

    $ cd
Open your .bashrc file with nano text editor

    $ nano .bashrc
Go to the bottom of the file and add the following lines

    export PATH="~/.cabal/bin:$PATH"
    export PATH="~/.local/bin:$PATH"


You need to restart your server or source your .bashrc file

    source .bashrc

Update cabal

    cabal update

Above instructions install Cabal version `3.2.0.0`. You can check the version by typing

   cabal --version

Download and install GHC:

    wget https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.6.5/ghc-8.6.5-x86_64-deb9-linux.tar.xz
    tar -xf ghc-8.6.5-x86_64-deb9-linux.tar.xz
    rm ghc-8.6.5-x86_64-deb9-linux.tar.xz
    cd ghc-8.6.5
    ./configure
    sudo make install
    cd ..

Install Libsodium

    git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/libsodium
    cd libsodium
    git checkout 66f017f1
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"


## Download the source code for cardano-node

To download the source code, we use git:

    git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node.git


This should create a folder ``cardano-node``, then download the latest source code from git into it.

After the download has finished, we can check its content by

    ls cardano-node

Note that the content of your ``cardano-node``-folder can slightly differ from this!

We change our working directory to the downloaded source code folder:

    cd cardano-node

For reproducible builds, we should check out a specific release, a specific "tag".
For the Shelley Testnet, we will use tag `1.15.1`, which we can check out as follows:

    git fetch --all --tags
    git tag
    git checkout tags/1.15.1


## Build and install the node

Now we build and install the node with ``cabal``, which will take a couple of minutes the first time you do a build. Later builds will be much faster, because everything that does not change will be cached.

   		cabal install cardano-node cardano-cli

This will build and install `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` into your `~/.cabal/bin` folder by default, so the remark about your `PATH` from above applies here as well: Make sure folder `~/.cabal/bin` is in your path or copy the executables to a folder that is. Alternatively you can run `cabal install cardano-node cardano-cli --installdir="$HOME/.local/bin"` to install the `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` directly into your `~/.local/bin` folder.

__Note__: When using __cabal install__, make sure you have `overwrite-policy: always` in your `.cabal/config` or delete old versions of `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` from `~/.cabal/bin`. Otherwise cabal install will not overwrite the old executables.

If you ever want to update the code to a newer version, go to the `cardano-node` directory, pull the latest code with ``git`` and rebuild.

This will be much faster than the initial build:

    cd cardano-node
    git fetch --all --tags
    git tag
    git checkout tags/<the-tag-you-want>
    cabal install cardano-node cardano-cli

This will build and install `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` into your `~/.cabal/bin` folder. Alternatively you can run `cabal install cardano-node cardano-cli --installdir="$HOME/.local/bin"` to install the `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` directly into your `~/.local/bin` folder.

__Note:__ It might be necessary to delete the `db`-folder (the database-folder) before running an updated version of the node.

We can start a node on the Cardano mainnet with

    scripts/mainnet.sh

Congratulations! You have installed the node, started it and connected it to the Cardano mainnet.
