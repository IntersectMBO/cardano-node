# Cardano Node CLI Reference

The Shelley command line interface (CLI) provides a collection of tools for key generation, transaction construction, certificate creation and other important tasks. It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.

This section provides a reference of the core `cardano-cli shelley` commands and their associated sub commands:

*cardano-cli shelley*
The set of `cardano-cli shelley` commands include:
* `address`: Shelley payment address commands
* `stake-address`: Shelley stake address commands
* `transaction`: Shelley transaction commands
* `node`: Shelley node operation commands
* `stake-pool`: Shelley stake pool commands
* `query`: Shelley node query commands. This queries the local node whose Unix domain socket is obtained from the CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH environment variable.
* `block`: Shelley block commands
* `system`: Shelley system commands
* `genesis`: Shelley genesis block commands
* `text-view`: commands for dealing with Shelley text view files that are stored on disk such as transactions or addresses
* `governance`: Shelley governance commands

*cardano-cli shelley address*
The `address` command contains the following sub commands:
* `key-gen`: creates a single address key pair
* `key-hash`: prints the hash of an address to stdout
* `build`: builds a Shelley payment address, with optional delegation to a stake address
* `build-script`: builds a Shelley script address.
* `info`: prints details about the address

*cardano-cli shelley stake-address*
The `stake-address` command contains the following sub commands:

* `registration-certificate`: creates a registration certificate
* `delegation-certificate`: creates a stake address delegation certificate
* `deregistration-certificate`: creates a de-registration certificate

*cardano-cli shelley transaction*
The `transaction` command contains the following sub commands:
* `build-raw`: builds a low-level transaction
* `sign`: signs the transaction
* `witness`: witnesses a transaction
* `sign-witness`: signs and witnesses a transaction
* `check`: checks the transaction
* `submit`: submits the transaction to the local node whose Unix domain socket is obtained from the CARANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH environment variable.
* `calculate-min-fee`: calculates the minimum fee for the transaction
* `info`: prints information about the transaction

*cardano-cli shelley node*
The `node` command contains the following sub commands:
* `key-gen`: creates a key pair for a node operator’s offline key and a new certificate issue counter
* `key-gen-KES`: creates a key pair for a node KES operational key
* `key-gen-VRF`: creates a key pair for a node VRF operational key
* `issue-op-cert`: issues a node operational certificate

*cardano-cli shelley stake-pool*
The `stake-pool` command contains the following sub commands:
* `register`: registers a stake pool
* `re-register`: re-registers a stake pool
* `retire`: retires a stake pool
* `registration-certificate`: creates a stake pool registration certificate
* `de-registration-certificate`: creates a stake pool de-registration certificate
* `id`:  builds pool id from the offline key

*cardano-cli shelley query*
The `query` command contains the following sub commands:
* `pool-id`: retrieves the node’s pool ID
* `protocol-parameters`: retrieves the node’s current pool parameters
* `tip`: gets the node’s current tip (slot number, hash, and block number)
* `utxo`: retrieves the node’s current UTxO, filtered by address
* `version`: retrieves the node’s version details
* `status`: retrieves the current status of the node
* `ledger-state`:  dumps the current state of the node
* `stake-address-info`: get the current delegations and reward accounts filtered by stake address.
* `stake-distribution`: get the node's current aggregated stake distribution

*cardano-cli shelley block*
The `block` command contains the following sub command:
* `info`: retrieves the pool ID that produced a particular block.

*cardano-cli shelley system*
The `system` command contains the following sub commands:
* `start`: starts the system
* `stop`: stops the system

*cardano-cli shelley governance*
The `governance` command contains the following sub commands:
* `create-mir-certificate`: creates an MIR (move instantaneous rewards) certificate
* `create-update-proposal`: creates an update proposal

* `key-gen-utxo`: creates a Shelley genesis UTxO key pair
* `key-hash`: prints the identifier, or hash, of a public key
* `get-ver-key`: derives verification key from a signing key
* `initial-addr`: gets the address for an initial UTxO based on the verification key
* `initial-txin`: gets the transaction ID for an initial UTxO based on the verification key.
* `create`: creates a Shelley genesis file from a genesis template, as well as genesis keys, delegation keys, and spending keys.

*cardano-cli shelley text-view*
The `text-view` command contains the following sub command:
* `decode-cbor`: prints a text view file, as decoded CBOR.
