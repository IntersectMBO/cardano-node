-- | 'ShutdownFDs' mediate the graceful shutdown requests,
-- either external or internal to the process.
--
-- In the external mediation case, the parent process passes us the file descriptor
-- number of the read end of a pipe, via the CLI with @--shutdown-ipc FD@.
-- In the internal mediation case, we create our own pipe.
-- In both cases we store the accessible ends in 'ShutdownFDs'.
--
-- In either case, if the write end gets closed, either deliberately:
--   - by internal call of 'triggerShutdown' on 'ShutdownFDs', or
--   - by parent process
-- ..or automatically, because the parent process itself terminated,
-- then we initiate a clean shutdown.
