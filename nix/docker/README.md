# Building Node and Submit API Images
To build and load the oci images into the Docker engine, the most
basic commands are:
```
# Build and load the cardano-node oci image
nix build .#dockerImage/node
docker load -i result

# Build and load the cardano-submit-api oci image
nix build .#dockerImage/submit-api
docker load -i result
```

From a bash shell, the following command example for the cardano-node image
offers a little more convenience by tagging the loaded image with `dev` and
also tagging with a git tag if one is present at the build git commit hash.
```
nix build .#dockerImage/node \
  && RES=$(docker load -i result) \
  && LOADED="${RES##Loaded image: }" \
  && GITHASH=$(git log -n1 --pretty='%H') \
  && docker tag "$LOADED" ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:dev \
  && docker rmi "$LOADED"

GITTAG=$(git describe --exact-match --tags $GITHASH)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Current tag: $GITTAG"
  docker tag ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:dev "ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:$GITTAG"
fi
```

To take a quick look around in the cardano-node container:
```
docker run \
  --rm -it --entrypoint=bash \
  ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:dev
```

A similar command can be run to look around the cardano-submit-api container.


# Cardano Node Image Operation
## Scripts Mode
To launch cardano-node with pre-loaded configuration, "scripts" mode,
use the `NETWORK` env variable to declare an existing cardano network name.

An example using a docker named volume to persist state to the host:
```
docker run \
  -v data:/data \
  -e NETWORK=mainnet \
  ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:dev
```

In "scripts" mode, default state directories include `/{data,ipc,logs}`, with
`/data/db` being the default database state location.


## Custom Mode
To launch cardano-node with a custom configuration, "custom" mode, provide
entrypoint args starting with `run` and:
* Leave the `NETWORK` env variable unset
* Optionally include additional cardano-node args to the entrypoint after `run`
* Optionally include environment variables interpreted by [nix/docker/context/bin/run-node](context/bin/run-node),
  or `/usr/local/bin/run-node` in the container

For example, launch a custom cardano-node container using cardano-node args and
a local configuration mapped into the container:
```
docker run \
  -v "$PWD/config/cardano:/config" \
  ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:dev \
  run \
  --config /config/mainnet/config.json \
  --topology /config/mainnet/topology.json \
  --database-path /data/db
```

Custom mode may also leverage standard mainnet or testnet network config
files found at `/opt/cardano/config` and organized under a subdirectory of the
network's name.  For example, to utilize standard configs for preprod network,
but modify the cardano-node listening port:
```
  docker run \
    -v preprod-data:/data \
    -e CARDANO_CONFIG="/opt/cardano/config/preprod/config.json" \
    -e CARDANO_TOPOLOGY="/opt/cardano/config/preprod/topology.json" \
    -e CARDANO_PORT="6001" \
    ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:dev \
    run
```

In "custom" mode, default state directories include
`/opt/cardano/{data,ipc,logs}`, with `/opt/cardano/data/db` being the default
database state location.  These state directories are symlinked to root in the container:
`/opt/cardano/{data,ipc,logs} -> /{data,ipc,logs}` for more consistency between modes.
Standard network config files can be found under `/opt/cardano/config`.


## Merge Mode
With the `NETWORK` env variable set and one or both of
`CARDANO_<CONFIG|TOPOLOGY>_JSON_MERGE` env variables set and containing valid
json, cardano-node will run with deep merged base `NETWORK` config and json
merge config.

Optional env variables and cardano-node args which can be used in custom mode
can also be used in this mode.  Merge mode uses the same default state
directories as custom mode.

An example:
```
docker run \
  -v node-ipc:/ipc \
  -v mainnet-data:/data \
  -e NETWORK=mainnet \
  -e CARDANO_CONFIG_JSON_MERGE='{"MaxConcurrencyBulkSync": 2}' \
  -e CARDANO_TOPOLOGY_JSON_MERGE='{"useLedgerAfterSlot": 147000000}' \
  ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:dev
```

## CLI Mode
To run cardano-cli, leave the `NETWORK` env variable unset and provide
entrypoint args starting with `cli` followed by cardano-cli command args.
The cardano-node ipc socket state will need to be provided in cli mode.

An example using a docker named volume to share cardano-node ipc socket state
follows. In this example, another container running cardano-node and also
sharing ipc socket state to the same named volume would already be running.
```
docker run \
  -v node-ipc:/ipc \
  ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:dev \
  cli \
  query tip \
  --mainnet
```

See the [Cardano-node socket sharing](#cardano-node-socket-sharing) section for
more on sharing ipc state between containers.


## Bind Mounting Considerations
For "custom" mode, the `/opt/cardano/{data,ipc,logs}` default state directories have been
symlinked to the "scripts" mode default state directories of `/{data,ipc,logs}`
respectively.  This makes bind mounting easier when switching between
"scripts" and "custom" container modes as bind mounting any of the root
default state directory locations, `/{data,ipc,logs}`, will work for both modes.


## Cardano-node Socket Sharing
To share a cardano-node socket with a different container, a volume can be made
for establishing cross-container communication:
```
docker run -v node-ipc:/ipc -e NETWORK=mainnet ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:dev
docker run -v node-ipc:/ipc -e NETWORK=mainnet ghcr.io/intersectmbo/some-node-client
```


## Pre-existing State Mounting
If pre-existing cardano-node database state for a network of interest is
available on the host, but not yet available in the container, the state can be
mapped into the container with a local volume driver bind mount.

An example using preprod state from a `$PWD/preprod-data` path follows.  Recall
from above that scripts, custom and merge modes use a default database state
location of `/data/db` either directly or indirectly by symlink, so the host
`$PWD/preprod-data` directory should contain the database state under a `db`
subdir.
```
docker run \
  -v "$PWD/preprod-data:/data" \
  -e NETWORK=preprod \
  ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:dev
```

Pre-existing host state may be obtained by any number of means such as host
cardano-node service, rsync'd known good state from a remote, [Mithril
snapshot](https://mithril.network/doc/) or other out-of-band methods.


## Host Mount Image Network Configs
To host mount and explore the image configuration files found under
`/opt/cardano` a new named docker volume can be created.  Docker will
initialize the new named volume with the contents of the container.

An example would be:
```
docker run \
  -v opt-cardano:/opt/cardano \
  ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:dev
```

The above command will create a new named volume of `opt-cardano` with the
container contents of `/opt/cardano` and print some image mode information
before exiting.  If there is already a named volume of `opt-cardano`, simply
select a different name, or allow a random name assignment by dropping the
`$NAME:` suffix of the `-v` option.

Exploring the configuration contents from the host after creating the named
volume can be done with commands such as:
```
docker volume ls

# Use the "Mountpoint" value in this command below
docker volume inspect opt-cardano

sudo tree /var/lib/docker/volumes/opt-cardano/_data
```

## Cardano Ledger Snapshot Conversion
The snapshot-converter utility is included in the cardano-node image at path
`/usr/local/bin/snapshot-converter`.  It can be used to convert between ledger
state types as needed, without relying on host level tooling or full
chain ledger replays.

An example follows to convert preprod ledger state in a named docker volume in
snapshot `295420` from `Legacy` to `Mem` when node is not already running:
```
docker run -v preprod-data:/data --rm -it --entrypoint=bash ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-node:dev -c '
  mv /data/db/ledger /data/db/ledger-old \
    && mkdir -p /data/db/ledger \
    && snapshot-converter Legacy /data/db/ledger-old/295420 Mem /data/db/ledger/295420 cardano --config /opt/cardano/config/preprod/config.json
```

Note that once ledger state is converted, the cardano-node container will need
to be run with a node configuration aligned with the new ledger state type,
otherwise ledger replay from genesis will re-occur.

# Cardano Submit API Image Operation
## Scripts Mode
To launch cardano-submit-api with pre-loaded configuration, "scripts" mode,
use the `NETWORK` env variable to declare an existing cardano network name.

An example using a docker named volume to share ipc socket state:
```
docker run \
  -v node-ipc:/ipc \
  -e NETWORK=mainnet \
  ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-submit-api:dev
```

In "scripts" mode, the `node.socket` file is expected at `/ipc`.


## Custom Mode
To launch cardano-submit-api with a custom configuration, "custom" mode,
leave the `NETWORK` env variable unset and provide a complete set of
cardano-submit-api args to the entrypoint.

For example:
```
docker run \
  -v node-ipc:/ipc \
  -v $PWD/config.json:/config.json \
  ghcr.io/intersectmbo/cardano-submit-api:dev \
  --config /config.json \
  --mainnet \
  --socket-path /ipc/node.socket
```

See the [docker-compose.yml](../../docker-compose.yml) file for a demonstration
of cardano-node and cardano-submit-api together.


## Bind Mounting Considerations:
In the cardano-submit-api container a `/node-ipc` directory is symlinked to `/ipc`
both to align the default ipc socket state directory in both the cardano-node
and cardano-submit-api images and to remain backwards compatible.
