##########################################################


##### Locations #####

GenesisFile: testnet_genesis.json
SocketPath: db/node.socket

#TODO: These parameters cannot yet be used in the config file, only on the CLI:
#DatabasePath: db/
#Topology: configuration/mainnet-topology.json
#Port 7776

##### Core protocol parameters #####

# This is the instance of the Ouroboros family that we are running.
# The node also supports various test and mock instances.
# "RealPBFT" is the real (ie not mock) (permissive) OBFT protocol, which
# is what we use on mainnet in Byron era.
Protocol: RealPBFT

# The mainnet does not include the network magic into addresses. Testnets do.
RequiresNetworkMagic: RequiresMagic


##### Update system parameters #####

# This protocol version number gets used by by block producing nodes as part
# part of the system for agreeing on and synchronising protocol updates.
LastKnownBlockVersion-Major: 1
LastKnownBlockVersion-Minor: 0
LastKnownBlockVersion-Alt: 0

# In the Byron era some software versions are also published on the chain.
# We do this only for Byron compatibility now.
ApplicationName: cardano-sl
ApplicationVersion: 0


##### Logging configuration #####

# The node can run in either the SimpleView or LiveView. The SimpleView just
# uses standard output, optionally with log output. The LiveView is a text
# console with a live view of various node metrics.
ViewMode: SimpleView

# Enble or disable logging overall
TurnOnLogging: True

# Enable the collection of various OS metrics such as memory and CPU use.
# These metrics can be directed to the logs or monitoring backends.
TurnOnLogMetrics: True

# Global logging severity filter. Messages must have at least this severity to
# pass. Typical values would be Warning, Notice, Info or Debug.
minSeverity: Notice

# Log items can be rendered with more or less verbose detail.
# The verbosity can be: MinimalVerbosity, NormalVerbosity
TracingVerbosity: NormalVerbosity

# The system supports a number of backends for logging and monitoring.
# This setting lists the the backends that will be available to use in the
# configuration below. The logging backend is called Katip. Also enable the EKG
# backend if you want to use the EKG or Prometheus monitoring interfaces.
# You can also enable trace forwarder backend if node should send the metrics
# to an external process.
setupBackends:
  - KatipBK
# - EKGViewBK
# - TraceForwarderBK

# This specifies the default backends that trace output is sent to if it
# is not specifically configured to be sent to other backends.
defaultBackends:
  - KatipBK

# EKG is a simple metrics monitoring system. Uncomment the following to listen
# on the given local port and point your web browser to http://localhost:12788/
# for a live view. The same URL can also serve JSON output.
# hasEKG: 12788

# The Prometheus monitoring system can also be used. Uncomment the following
# to listen on the given port
# hasPrometheus: 12789

# For the Katip logging backend we must set up outputs (called scribes)
# The available types of scribe are:
#   FileSK for files
#   StdoutSK/StdoutSK for stdout/stderr
#   JournalSK for systemd's journal system
#   DevNullSK
# The scribe output format can be ScText or ScJson. Log rotation settings can
# be specified in the defaults below or overidden on a per-scribe basis here.
setupScribes:
  - scKind: FileSK
    scName: "logs/testnet.log"
    scFormat: ScText

  - scKind: StdoutSK
    scName: stdout
    scFormat: ScText
    scRotation: null

# For the Katip logging backend this specifies the default scribes that trace
# output is sent to if it is not configured to be sent to other scribes.
defaultScribes:
  - - FileSK
    - "logs/testnet.log"

  - - StdoutSK
    - stdout

# The default file rotation settings for katip scribes, unless overridden
# in the setupScribes above for specific scribes.
rotation:
  rpLogLimitBytes: 5000000
  rpKeepFilesNum:  3
  rpMaxAgeHours:   24


##### Coarse grained logging control #####

# Trace output from whole subsystems can be enabled/disabled using the following
# settings. This provides fairly coarse grained control, but it is relatively
# efficient at filtering out unwanted trace output.

# Trace BlockFetch client.
TraceBlockFetchClient: False

# Trace BlockFetch decisions made by the BlockFetch client.
TraceBlockFetchDecisions: False

# Trace BlockFetch protocol messages.
TraceBlockFetchProtocol: False

# Serialised Trace BlockFetch protocol messages.
TraceBlockFetchProtocolSerialised: False

# Trace BlockFetch server.
TraceBlockFetchServer: False

# Verbose tracer of ChainDB
TraceChainDb: True

# Trace ChainSync client.
TraceChainSyncClient: False

# Trace ChainSync server (blocks).
TraceChainSyncBlockServer: False

# Trace ChainSync server (headers)
TraceChainSyncHeaderServer: False

# Trace ChainSync protocol messages.
TraceChainSyncProtocol: False

# Trace DNS Resolver messages.
TraceDNSResolver: True

# Trace DNS Subscription messages.
TraceDNSSubscription: True

# Trace error policy resolution.
TraceErrorPolicy: True

# Trace local error policy resolution.
TraceLocalErrorPolicy: True

# Trace block forging.
TraceForge: True

# Trace Handshake protocol messages.
TraceHandshake: False

# Trace IP Subscription messages.
TraceIpSubscription: True

# Trace local ChainSync protocol messages.
TraceLocalChainSyncProtocol: False

# Trace local Handshake protocol messages.
TraceLocalHandshake: False

# Trace local TxSubmission protocol messages.
TraceLocalTxSubmissionProtocol: False

# Trace local TxSubmission server.
TraceLocalTxSubmissionServer: False

# Trace mempool.
TraceMempool: True

# Trace Mux Events
TraceMux: False

# Trace TxSubmission server (inbound transactions).
TraceTxInbound: False

# Trace TxSubmission client (outbound transactions).
TraceTxOutbound: False

# Trace TxSubmission protocol messages.
TraceTxSubmissionProtocol: False


##### Fine grained logging control #####

# It is also possible to have more fine grained control over filtering of
# trace output, and to match and route trace output to particular backends.
# This is less efficient than the coarse trace filters above but provides
# much more precise control.

options:

  # This routes metrics matching specific names to particular backends.
  # This overrides the defaultBackends listed above. And note that it is
  # and override and not an extension so anything matched here will not
  # go to the default backend, only to the explicitly listed backends.
  mapBackends:
    cardano.node.ChainDB.metrics:
      - EKGViewBK
    cardano.node.metrics:
      - EKGViewBK
