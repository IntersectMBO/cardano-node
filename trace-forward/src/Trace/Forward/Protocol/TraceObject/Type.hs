-- | A kind to identify our protocol, and the types of the states in the state
-- transition diagram of the protocol.
--
-- IMPORTANT NOTE: the following terminology is used:
--
-- 1. From the protocol's point of view, two peers talk to each other:
--    the forwarder and the acceptor.
-- 2. The forwarder is an application that collects 'TraceObject's and sends
--    them to the acceptor by request (with 'MsgTraceObjectsReply').
-- 3. The acceptor is an application that receives 'TraceObject's from the
--    forwarder.
-- 4. You can think of the acceptor as a client, and the forwarder as a server.
--    After the connection is established, the acceptor asks for 'TraceObject's,
--    the forwarder replies to it.

-- | The acceptor will send this request to the forwarder.

  -- must provide this information.

    -- always have at least one 'TraceObject', and it does not expect a prompt
    -- reply: there is no timeout. This covers the case when there

  -- | This is an explanation of our states, in terms of which party has agency
  -- in each state.
  --
  -- 1. When both peers are in Idle state, the acceptor can send a message
  --    to the forwarder (request for new 'TraceObject's),
  -- 2. When both peers are in Busy state, the forwarder is expected to send
  --    a reply to the acceptor (list of new 'TraceObject's).
  --
  -- So we assume that, from __interaction__ point of view:
  -- 1. ClientHasAgency (from 'Network.TypedProtocol.Core') corresponds to acceptor's agency.
  -- 3. ServerHasAgency (from 'Network.TypedProtocol.Core') corresponds to forwarder's agency.
