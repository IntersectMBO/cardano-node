# Changelog for cardano-cli

## 1.33.0 -- December 2021
## 1.32.1 -- November 2021

- Default CLI commands to the Alonzo era. (#3339)
- Add defaults for building the Alonzo genesis. (#3346)

## 1.31.0 -- October 2021

- Restore support for deserialising transactions built by pre-1.27.0.0 node
  versions. (#3226)
- Various internal refactorings and improvements. (#3234)
- Use the new `GetChainBlockNo` and `GetChainPoint` queries in the query tip
  command. There is a fallback to the older method using the full chain sync
  query. (#3179)
- Allow provision of optional datums to a transaction using the CLI option
  `--tx-out-datum-embed-value`. This mechanism can for example be used to
  provide the actual script locking an output, for use when spending it. (#3171)
- Fix the use of withdrawls using the `transaction build` command. (#3317)
- Allow extended payment keys to be specified as a Plutus required signer.
  (#3319)

## 1.30.0 -- September 2021

- Allow the user to specify a signature as required when spending from a
  multisig/timelock script using the `build` or `build-raw` commands. Required
  signers *must* be present in the witnesses, and only required signers are
  visible to Plutus scripts. (#3123)
- Use a separate connection for the `query tip` command. This fixes an
  occasional bug where the `query tip` command would fail. (#3130)
- Print the Tx fee when using the `tx build` command. (#3032)
- The `tx build` command now validates its inputs (ensuring they are in the UTxO
  and that only basic VKey-locked inputs are used as collateral.) (#3151)
- Add a new comment to query the stake pools. (#3152)
- `tx build` now uses the set of existing stake pools to determing if a pool is
  already registered (and hence whether it must pay a deposit). (#3152)
- `calculate-min-req-utxo` now requires a transaction output, not just a value
  as before. This is required in the Alonzo era, and the change is made
  everywhere for consistency. (#3181)
- Allow the `tx build` command to spend the entirety of a UTxO and create no
  change output. (#3188)
- Add withdrawls to the `tx view` command. (#2613)
## 1.29.0 -- August 2021

- Add a "tx build" command to the CLI. This command takes care of calculating
  the appropriate fee for a transaction, and balancing the transaction
  appropriately. It does not do input selection for fees, so sufficient balance
  must be available in the inputs to pay the computed fee, and sufficient
  collateral must also be present when phase-2 validating scripts are used. The
  tx build command is capable of computing both the fees required from
  transaction size and the fees incurred by script execution. (#2921, #2953,
  #2995, #3025)
- Improve the output format for rational fields in protocol parameters and
  genesis. When these are simple, we now convert them to decimal format. (#2992)
- Various internal improvements. (#2932)
- Make the CLI help text more nicely formatted. (#2945)
- Introduce the `--script-valid` and `--script-invalid` flags. The latter can be
  used to mark a script as being known invalid, such that the node will allow it
  to be submitted anyway (whereas under normal operation it would reject such a
  transaction in order to avoid loss of collateral). This flag is only likely to
  be of use in testing. The `--script-valid` flag is set as a default. (#3050,
  #3091, #3093)
- Add colours to the CLI output. (#3023)
## 1.28.0 -- July 2021

- The query tip command is now tidier and shows various additional pieces of
  information:
  - The epoch number is now shown during the Byron era.  Previously this worked
    only in the Shelley and subsequent eras. (#2688)
  - The sync progress of the node. This will only be available with new network
    protocols (not yet in this release.) (#2842, #2899)
  (#2885)
- Attempting to use an IPv6/IPv4 address where the other is expected will now
  give a more helpful error message. (#2691)
- Queries should now work during the Alonzo era. (#2727, #2755)
- Support for submitting transactions during the Alonzo era. (#2774, #2798,
  #2806, #2811, #2823, #2863, #2848)
- `cardano-cli genesis create` now also creates the new Alonzo genesis file.
  (#2743)
- The UTxO CLI query now allows an additional `--tx-in` flag which allows
  filtering the UTxO by TxIn, and requires the addition of the `--whole-utxo`
  flag to return the complete UTxO set (which was previously the default).
  Returning the whole UTxO set is an expensive operation only useful in small
  testnets, so we don't want it as the default option. (#2843, #2854)
- The parser for rational units (as used in for example execution unit prices)
  now supports rational syntax (e.g. 1/2). (#2922)

## 1.27.0 -- April 2021

- The query tip now also returns the era (e.g. Shelley, Allegra, Alonzo).
  (#2561, #2562, #2598)
- The `address build` command now incorporates the functionality of the script
  address build command, which is now deprecated. (#2486, #2587)
- Add additional commands for creating MIR certificates to the CLI. This
  supports the ability to transfer funds to the treasury for Catalyst projects.
  (#2503)
- As a result of refactoring in preparation for the upcoming Alonzo release,
  there are a couple of breaking changes in CLI commands referring to scripts:
  - Auxiliary scripts (i.e. those included in the Tx auxiliary data, which are
    not required as transaction signers) must now be included with
    `--auxiliary-script-file` rather than with `--script-file`.
  - Scripts witnessing txins, certificates, withdrawals and minting must now be
    paired with the thing they are witnessing. E.g.
    ```
    --certificate-file  $certfile --certificate-script-file $scriptfile
    --tx-out $txout --minting-script-file $scriptfile
    --withdrawal $withdrawal --withdrawal-script-file $scriptfile
    --tx-in $txin --txin-script-file $scriptfile
    ```
  - Scripts should now be specified when creating the txbody, rather than when
    signing the transaction. (#2547)
- The transaction view command now additionally shows detailed of minted
  non-native tokens. (#2550)
- Removed support for Byron addresses using the Bech32 encoding. The only
  supported way to use Byron-era addresses is through a file, using the text
  envelope format. (#2605)
- Add a new command which computes the minimum ADA value/deposit for a
  multi-asset value. (#2612)
- Add two new query commands:
  - `query stake-snapshot` allows querying the three stake snapshots for a given
    stake pool.
  - `query pool-params` returns the current and future parameters, as well as
    the retiring information.
  (#2560)
- Updated the CLI reference documentation. (#2665)

## 1.26.1 -- March 2021
- It's no longer necessary to specify the era when making a CLI query. When not
  specified, the current era will be used as a default. (#2470)

## 1.26.0 -- March 2021
- Add three new queries to the CLI, exposing functionality already present in
  the API:
  - Protocol parameters
  - Stake distribution
  - Individual stake addresses
  (#2275, #2290)
- Fix the rendering of Byron-era `TxOut`s to be consistent with the rendering for
  Shelley-era addresses. (#2472)
- Add `cardano-cli transaction view`, which allows for pretty-printing details
  about a serialised transaction. (#2348)
- When constructing MIR certificates, the CLI now takes stake addresses rather
  than stake certificates. These are strictly more general and can be deduced
  from the certificates.
- Make the Mary era the default era in the CLI (#2415)
- Migrate the `cardano-submit-api` tool from `cardano-rest`. (#2370)
- The 'tip' query now additionally returns the epoch at the tip (#2440)
- Various internal improvements and refactoring (#2458)

## 1.25.0 -- January 2021
- Allow creating transactions with no outputs (#2223, #2226)
- Improved error messages for syntax errors in out-of-range lovelace quantities
  in transaction outputs (#2063, #2079)
- Improved reference documentation for simple scripts and their use (#2165)
- Refactoring in the Byron part of the CLI to make more extensive use of the
  Cardano API and reduce the maintenance burden (#2103, #2228)
- Remove support for changing the delegation from Genesis keys to operational
  keys in the Byron era. This feature was never used on the mainnet during the
  Byron era. (#2219)
- Clearer usage information in the CLI `--help` output (#2203)

## 1.24.2 -- December 2020

- Rename the flags `--lower-bound` and `--upper-bound` to be `--invalid-before`
  and `--invalid-hereafter` respectively, for naming consistency (#2186, #2190)
- Hide the deprecated `--ttl` flag in the `--help` output (#2189, #2190)

## 1.24.1 -- December 2020

- New command `transaction policyid` for making multi-asset policy ids (#2176)
- New command `byron transaction txid` to help scripts with getting the
  transaction id for Byron transactions made using the cli (#2169)
- New `--tx-file` flag for the command `transaction txid` to accept complete
  txs, not just tx bodies (#2169)
- Add a regression test for the "0" case of multi-asset tx out values (#2155)

## 1.24.0 -- December 2020

- CLI support for the Allegra and Mary eras, including creating transactions
  for the new eras, and support for the special new features in the new eras:
  script extensions, tx validity intervals, auxiliary scripts, multi-asset tx
  outputs and asset minting. (#2072, #2129, #2136)
- New flags for the `build-raw` command:
  + `--invalid-before` and `--invalid-hereafter` for the new Allegra-era feature
    of transaction validity intervals. The existing flag `--ttl` is equivalent to
    the new `--invalid-hereafter`, but it is now optional in the Allegra era.
  + `--script-file` for the new Allegra-era feature of being able to include
     auxiliary scripts in a transaction.
  + `--mint` for the Mary-era token minting feature.
- It is now necessary to specify the target era (e.g. `--allegra-era`) when
  creating a transaction (with `build-raw`) so that the right format and
  feature-set is used. The `--shelley-era` remains the default.
- It is necessary for now to specify the target era when using the CLI query
  commands. This may become automatic in future. The default is `--shelley-era`.
- Move all the Shelley sub-commands to the top level of the command line.
  For example `cardano-cli shelley transaction build-raw` becomes simply
  `cardano-cli transaction build-raw`. The existing names are also kept for
  compatibility. (#2076, #2145)
- Updated help text for the ledger/protocol state queries to clarify that they
  are primarily for debugging and are not stable interfaces (#2125, #2126, #2133)
- New command `genesis create-staked` to make it easier to set up Shelley-based
  testnets with stake pools and delegation set up from the genesis. (#2052)
