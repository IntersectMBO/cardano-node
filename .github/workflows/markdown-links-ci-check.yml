# When pushing branches (and/or updating PRs), we do want to cancel previous
# build runs. We assume they are stale now; and do not want to spend CI time and
# resources on continuing to continue those runs. This is what the concurrency.group
# value lets us express. When using merge queues, we now have to consider
# - runs triggers by commits per pull-request
#   we want to cancel any previous run. So they should all get the same group (per PR)
# - runs refs/heads/gh-readonly-queue/<target branch name> (they should all get their
#   unique git ref, we don't want to cancel any of the ones in the queue)
# - if it's neither, we fall back to the run_id (this is a unique number for each
#   workflow run; it does not change if you "rerun" a job)
