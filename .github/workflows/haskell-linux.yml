#   we want to cancel any previous run. So they should all get the same group (per PR)
# - runs refs/heads/gh-readonly-queue/<target branch name> (they should all get their
#   unique git ref, we don't want to cancel any of the ones in the queue)
# - if it's neither, we fall back to the run_id (this is a unique number for each
#   workflow run; it does not change if you "rerun" a job)
