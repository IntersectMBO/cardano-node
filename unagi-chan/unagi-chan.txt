-- | This library provides implementations of concurrent FIFO queues (for
--   both general boxed and primitive unboxed values) that are fast,
--   perform well under contention, and offer a Chan-like interface. The
--   library may be of limited usefulness outside of x86 architectures
--   where the fetch-and-add instruction is not available.
--   
--   We export several variations of our design; some support additional
--   functionality while others try for lower latency by removing features
--   or making them more restrictive (e.g. in the <tt>Unboxed</tt>
--   variants).
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><tt>Unagi</tt>: a general-purpose near drop-in replacement for
--   <tt>Chan</tt>.</li>
--   <li><tt>Unagi.Unboxed</tt>: like <tt>Unagi</tt> but specialized for
--   primitive types; this may perform better if a queue grows very
--   large.</li>
--   <li><tt>Unagi.Bounded</tt>: a bounded variant with blocking and
--   non-blocking writes, and other functionality where a notion of the
--   queue's capacity is required.</li>
--   <li><tt>Unagi.NoBlocking</tt>: lowest latency implementations for when
--   blocking reads aren't required.</li>
--   <li><tt>Unagi.NoBlocking.Unboxed</tt>: like <tt>Unagi.NoBlocking</tt>
--   but for primitive types.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   Some of these may be deprecated in the future if they are found to
--   provide little performance benefit, or no unique features; you should
--   benchmark and experiment with them for your use cases, and please
--   submit pull requests for additions to the benchmark suite that reflect
--   what you find.
--   
--   Here is an example benchmark measuring the time taken to concurrently
--   write and read 100,000 messages, with work divided amongst increasing
--   number of readers and writers, comparing against the top-performing
--   queues in the standard libraries. The inset graph shows a zoomed-in
--   view on the implementations here.

module Control.Concurrent.Chan.Unagi.Unboxed

data OutChan a

-- | Our class of types supporting primitive array operations. Instance

class (Prim a, Eq a) => UnagiPrim a

-- | When the read and write operations of the underlying <tt>Prim</tt>
--   instances on aligned memory are atomic, this may be set to <tt>Just
--   x</tt> where <tt>x</tt> is some rare (i.e. unlikely to occur
--   frequently in your data) magic value; this might help speed up some
--   <tt>UnagiPrim</tt> operations.
--   
--   Where those <tt>Prim</tt> instance operations are not atomic, this
--   *must* be set to <tt>Nothing</tt>.
atomicUnicorn :: UnagiPrim a => Maybe a

-- | Read an element from the chan, blocking if the chan is empty.
--   
--   <i>Note re. exceptions</i>: When an async exception is raised during a

--   empty queue. If you need to handle this scenario, you can use
--   <a>readChanOnException</a>.
readChan :: UnagiPrim a => OutChan a -> IO a

-- | Like <a>readChan</a> but allows recovery of the queue element which
--   would have been read, in the case that an async exception is raised
--   during the read. To be precise exceptions are raised, and the handler
--   run, only when <tt>readChanOnException</tt> is blocking.
--   
--   The second argument is a handler that takes a blocking IO action
--   returning the element, and performs some recovery action. When the
--   handler is called, the passed <tt>IO a</tt> is the only way to access
--   the element.
readChanOnException :: UnagiPrim a => OutChan a -> (IO a -> IO ()) -> IO a

--   <i>Note</i>: This is a destructive operation. See <a>Element</a> for

--   
--   If you're using this function exclusively you might find the

--   <li>an <tt><a>Element</a> a</tt> future, which returns one unique
--   element when it becomes available via <a>tryRead</a>.</li>
--   <li>a blocking <tt>IO</tt> action that returns the element when it
--   becomes available.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   <i>Note</i>: This is a destructive operation. See <a>Element</a> for
--   more details.
--   
--   <i>Note re. exceptions</i>: When an async exception is raised during a
--   <tt>tryReadChan</tt> the message that the read would have returned is

tryReadChan :: OutChan a -> IO (Element a, IO a)

-- | An <tt>IO</tt> action that returns a particular enqueued element when
--   and if it becomes available.
--   
--   Each <tt>Element</tt> corresponds to a particular enqueued element,
--   i.e. a returned <tt>Element</tt> always offers the only means to
--   access one particular enqueued item. The value returned by
--   <tt>tryRead</tt> moves monotonically from <tt>Nothing</tt> to <tt>Just
--   a</tt> when and if an element becomes available, and is idempotent at
--   that point.
--   
--   So for instance:
--   
--   <pre>
--   (in, out) &lt;- newChan
--   (el, _) &lt;- tryReadChan out  -- READ FROM EMPTY CHAN
--   writeChan in "msg1"
--   writeChan in "msg2"
--   readChan out        -- RETURNS "msg2"
--   tryRead el          -- RETURNS "msg1" (which would otherwise be lost)
--   </pre>
newtype Element a
Element :: IO (Maybe a) -> Element a
[tryRead] :: Element a -> IO (Maybe a)

-- | Return a lazy infinite list representing the contents of the supplied
--   OutChan, much like System.IO.hGetContents.
getChanContents :: OutChan a -> IO [a]

-- | Return the estimated length of a bounded queue
--   
--   The more concurrent writes and reads that are happening, the more
--   inaccurate the estimate of the chan's size is likely to be.
estimatedLength :: InChan a -> IO Int

-- | Write a value to the channel. If the chan is full this will block.
--   
--   To be precise this <i>may</i> block when the number of elements in the
--   queue <tt>&gt;= size</tt>, and will certainly block when <tt>&gt;=
--   size*2</tt>, where <tt>size</tt> is the argument passed to
--   <tt>newChan</tt>, rounded up to the next highest power of two.
--   
--   <i>Note re. exceptions</i>: In the case that an async exception is
--   raised while blocking here, the write will nonetheless succeed. When
--   not blocking, exceptions are masked. Thus writes always succeed once
--   <a>writeChan</a> is entered.
writeChan :: InChan a -> a -> IO ()

-- | Try to write a value to the channel, aborting if the write is likely
--   to exceed the bounds, returning a <tt>Bool</tt> indicating whether the
--   write was successful.
--   
--   This function never blocks, but may occasionally write successfully to
--   a queue that is already "full". Unlike <a>writeChan</a> this function
--   treats the requested bounds (raised to nearest power of two) strictly,
--   rather than using the <tt>n .. n*2</tt> range. The more concurrent
--   writes and reads that are happening, the more inaccurate the estimate
--   of the chan's size is likely to be.
tryWriteChan :: InChan a -> a -> IO Bool

-- | Write an entire list of items to a chan type. Writes here from
--   multiple threads may be interleaved, and infinite lists are supported.
writeList2Chan :: InChan a -> [a] -> IO ()

-- | Duplicate a chan: the returned <tt>OutChan</tt> begins empty, but data
--   written to the argument <tt>InChan</tt> from then on will be available
--   from both the original <tt>OutChan</tt> and the one returned here,
--   creating a kind of broadcast channel.
--   
--   Writers will be blocked only when the fastest reader falls behind the
--   bounds; slower readers of duplicated <a>OutChan</a> may fall
--   arbitrarily behind.
dupChan :: InChan a -> IO (OutChan a)
