-- * Disk IO stats:
-- /proc/[pid]/io (since kernel 2.6.20)
--        This file contains I/O statistics for the process, for example:
--
--               # cat /proc/3828/io
--               rchar: 323934931
--               wchar: 323929600
--               syscr: 632687
--               syscw: 632675
--               read_bytes: 0
--               write_bytes: 323932160
--               cancelled_write_bytes: 0
--
--        The fields are as follows:
--
--        rchar: characters read
--               The number of bytes which this task has caused to be read from storage.  This is simply the  sum
--               of bytes which this process passed to read(2) and similar system calls.  It includes things such
--               as terminal I/O and is unaffected by whether or not actual physical disk I/O was  required  (the
--               read might have been satisfied from pagecache).
--
--        wchar: characters written
--               The  number  of bytes which this task has caused, or shall cause to be written to disk.  Similar
--               caveats apply here as with rchar.
--
--        syscr: read syscalls
--               Attempt to count the number of read I/O operations-that is, system calls  such  as  read(2)  and
--               pread(2).
--
--        syscw: write syscalls
--               Attempt  to  count the number of write I/O operations-that is, system calls such as write(2) and
--               pwrite(2).
--
--        read_bytes: bytes read
--               Attempt to count the number of bytes which this process really did cause to be fetched from  the
--               storage layer.  This is accurate for block-backed filesystems.
--
--        write_bytes: bytes written
--               Attempt to count the number of bytes which this process caused to be sent to the storage layer.
--
--        cancelled_write_bytes:
--               The  big  inaccuracy  here  is truncate.  If a process writes 1MB to a file and then deletes the
--               file, it will in fact perform no writeout.  But it will have been accounted as having caused 1MB
--               of  write.   In other words: this field represents the number of bytes which this process caused
--               to not happen, by truncating pagecache.  A task can cause "negative"  I/O  too.   If  this  task
--               truncates  some  dirty  pagecache,  some  I/O  which another task has been accounted for (in its
--               write\_bytes) will not be happening.
--
--        Note: In the current implementation, things are a bit racy  on  32-bit  systems:  if  process  A  reads
--        process  B's  /proc/[pid]/io  while process B is updating one of these 64-bit counters, process A could
--        see an intermediate result.
--
--        Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace access mode PTRACE\_MODE\_READ\_FSCREDS check;  see
--        ptrace(2).
