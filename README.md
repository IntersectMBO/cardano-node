[networking](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/tree/master/ouroboros-network)
and [node shell](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-shell)
repositories.
[Logging](https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-monitoring-framework) is
provided as
a [feature](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-shell/blob/master/app/Cardano/Shell/Features/Logging.hs)
by the node shell to the other packages.

## Building cardano-node from source
**cardano-node** is written in **Haskell** programing language and uses **Cabal** build target definitions, which means both `cabal-install` and `stack` could be used to build `cardano-node`, however only `stack` is a supported method in this tutorial. In theory, building `cardano-node` on most platforms should be feasible, however only [Tier 1 platforms of The Glasgow Haskell Compiler](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/platforms) are within scope of this tutorial.

### Building cardano-node on Linux with x86_64 architecture
In this tutorial we assume you're starting your build on frest, minimal install of your chosen Linux distribution, so firstly we will install basic required tools and libraries, we will need to install following:

* curl - command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs
* Git - Version Control System (SCM) also refered to as Source Code Management System (SCM)
* OpenSSL - software library and tool containing highly optimized version of basic cryptography primitives
* journald - system service for collecting and storing log data, introduced with `systemd`
* zlib - software library used for data compression

#### Installing required tools on different Linux distributions
Open a terminal window and execute distribution specific commands under regular user with elevated priviledges using `sudo`.

**Debian** / **Ubuntu**

```bash
sudo apt-get update # Update metadata for backages provided by your Linux distribution
sudo apt-get install -y curl git libssl-dev libsystemd-dev zlib1g-dev # Install required libraries and their header files required to build software
```
**RHEL** / **CentOS** / **Fedora**

```bash
sudo yum install -y curl git openssl-devel systemd-devel zlib-devel # Install required libraries and their header files required to build software
```

**SLES** / **openSUSE**

```bash
sudo zypper install -y curl gcc git gmp-devel libopenssl-devel systemd-devel zlib-devel # Install required libraries and their header files required to build software
```

#### Installing `stack` software building toolkit on all Linux distributions
Execute `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh -s --` in the open terminal window and enter `root` password when prompted:

```bash
ladm_mark_stopka@mark-asus-zenbook-s:~> curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh -s --
Detected Linux distribution: opensuse

This installer doesn't support your Linux distribution, trying generic

Installing Stack to: /usr/local/bin/stack...

About to use 'sudo' to run the following command as root:
    install -c -o 0 -g 0 -m 0755 /tmp/tmp.h54iH2BT2W/stack /usr/local/bin
in order to copy 'stack' to the destination directory.

[sudo] password for root:
```

#### Make a copy of `cardano-node` source-code repository with Git
Use Git to make a `clone` of `cardano-node` GitHub repository and switch into the local copy, in open terminal window, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/
cd cardano-node
```

#### Initiate `cardano-node` build with `stack`
Use [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) to build required `cardano-node` binaries, there are 4 executable targets defined for `cardano-node`, however only `cardano-cli` and `cardano-node` are required to connect to the Cardano Blockchain network. In open terminal window, run:

```bash
stack build \
      --flag cardano-node:-with_wallet-client \
      --flag cardano-node:-with_chairman
      cardano-node
stack install \
      --flag cardano-node:-with_wallet-client \
      --flag cardano-node:-with_chairman
      cardano-node
```

Unless you've changed some other configuration, or the build failed for some reason ([open GitHub Issue](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/new)), your `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` binaries are in `~/.local/bin` directory, which content you can list by issuing `ls -l ~/.local/bin` command.
