# The default.nix file. This will generate targets for all
# buildables (see release.nix for nomenclature, excluding
# the "build machine" last part, specific to release.nix), eg.:
#
# Generated targets include anything from stack.yaml
# (via nix-tools:stack-to-nix and the nix/regenerate.sh script)
# or cabal.project (via nix-tools:plan-to-nix), including all
# version overrides specified there.
#
# Nix-tools stack-to-nix will generate the `nix/.stack-pkgs.nix`
# file which is imported from the `nix/pkgs.nix` where further
# customizations outside of the ones in stack.yaml/cabal.project
# can be specified as needed for nix/ci.
#
# Please run `nix/regenerate.sh` after modifying stack.yaml
# or relevant part of cabal configuration files.
# When switching to recent stackage or hackage package version,
# you might also need to update the iohk-nix common lib. You
# can do so by running the `nix/update-iohk-nix.sh` script.
#
# More information about iohk-nix and nix-tools is available at:
# https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix/blob/master/docs/nix-toolification.org#for-a-stackage-project
#


# We will need to import the iohk-nix common lib, which includes
# the nix-tools tooling.
