  # nix-tools packages are prefixed with `nix-tools` and

  #   namespace                      optional cross compilation prefix                 build machine
  #   .-------.                              .-----------------.                .--------------------------.

  #             '--------------------------'                    '-------------'
  #                 component type                          cabal pkg and component*
  #
  # * note that for `libs`, $component is empty, as cabal only
  #   provides a single library for packages right now.
  # * note that for `exes`, $component is also empty, because it
  #   it provides all exes under a single result directory.
  #   To  specify a single executable component to build, use
  #   `cexes` as component type.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   nix-tools.libs.ouroboros-consensus.x86_64-darwin -- will build the ouroboros-consensus library on and for macOS
  #   nix-tools.libs.x86_64-pc-mingw32-ouroboros-network.x86_64-linux -- will build the ouroboros-network library on linux for windows.
  #   nix-tools.tests.ouroboros-consensus.test-crypto.x86_64-linux -- will build and run the test-crypto from the
  #                                                          ouroboros-consensus package on linux.
