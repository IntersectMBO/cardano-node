-- Payment addresses
--

-- | Addresses are used as locations where assets live. The address determines
-- the rights needed to spend assets at the address: in particular holding some
-- signing key or being able to satisfy the conditions of a script.
--
-- There are currently two types of address:
--
-- * Byron addresses, which use the type tag 'ByronAddr'; and
-- * Shelley addresses, which use the type tag 'ShelleyAddr'. Notably, Shelley
--   addresses support scripts and stake delegation.
--
-- The /address type/ is subtly from the /ledger era/ in which each
-- address type is valid: while Byron addresses are the only choice in the
-- Byron era, the Shelley era and all subsequent eras support both Byron and
-- Shelley addresses. The 'Address' type param only says the type of the address
-- (either Byron or Shelley). The 'AddressInEra' type connects the address type
-- with the era in which it is supported.
