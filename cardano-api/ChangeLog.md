  `nextEpochEligibleLeadershipSlots` to get the leadership slots for the
  current/next epoch respectively. (#3464, #3494)

  software. (#3501)

  (#2253, #3606)

## 1.33.0 -- December 2021
## 1.32.1 -- November 2021

- Asset names are now rendered in a more consistent fashion in JSON output.
  Previously names which happened to be valid ASCII were rendered as such, and
  ones which were not resulted in unprintable characters. Now all names are
  rendered as hex. Future clients may choose to additionally render ASCII names
  if plausible to do so. (#3211)
- Various testing improvements. (#3361)
- Expose ledger events via the ledger state API. (#3374)

## 1.31.0 -- October 2021

- Various internal improvements and refactorings. (#3163, #3253, #3288)

## 1.30.0 -- September 2021

- Improvements to the ledger state API. (#3143)
- Make it easier to use monadic queries. (#3151)
- Implement 'getBlockHeader' for Alonzo. This was a stray function that got
  missed when implementing Alonzo in the API. (#3158)
- A few additional exports for API consumers. (#3156)
- Expose ledger events through the API. Ledger events provide a way for
  consumers to receive details about things that are happening inside the
  ledger, and will be used by tools such as db-sync. (#3085)
- Improve the error message reported when you try to spend a non-Plutus locked
  input using a Plutus script. (#3187)


## 1.29.0 -- August 2021

- Support for automated Tx building. (#2953)
- A few additional exports for API consumers. (#3001, #3055)
- Miscallaneous internal improvements. (#2948)
- Block folding interface now derives the network ID automatically from the
  ledger config. (#2955, #2975)
- Improve the error generated when a Tx output does not meet the minimum UTxO
  value. (#3027)
- Add support for querying the Alonzo ledger state. (#2974)
- Update the API documentation.

## 1.28.0 -- July 2021

- Support for the upcoming Alonzo era, including protocol parameters, Plutus
  scripts and collateral inputs. (#2784, #2798, #2808, #2810, #2815, #2818,
  #2823, #2828)
- Add a function 'getTransactionBodyContent'. This extracts a general view of
  the TxBody from the era-specific bodies. (#2663)
- Add API support for new node queries:
  - `QuerySystemStart` gets the system start time.
  - `QueryStakePools` and `QueryStakePoolParameters` can be used to get details
    on the currently known stake pools.
  - `QueryUTxOFilter` provides various ways to query a filtered subset of the
    UTxO.
  (#2843)
- Added functions to the API to assist in automated transaction building:
  - `evaluateTransactionBalance` computes the current balance of a (partial)
    transaction, which is helpful for determining what needs to be done to
    correctly balance it (such that value produced equals value consumed).
  - `evaluateTransactionExecutionUnits` computes how many ExUnits will be needed
    by all the scripts in a (partial) transaction.
  - `evaluateTransactionFee` computes the fee for a (partial) transaction,
    assuming a given number of VKey witnesses (corresponding to inputs).
  - `estimateTransactionKeyWitnessCount` attempts to estimate the number of VKey
    witnesses needed.
  - `makeTransactionBodyAutoBalance` attempts to create and automatically
    balance a transaction body, using the above tools.
  (#2906)
- Miscellaneous internal improvements. (#2836, #2840)

## 1.27.0 -- April 2021

- Add initial support for the ledger state and folding over blocks to the API.
  (#2633)
- Scripts are now stored within the TxBody in the API, rather than in the
  witnesses. (#2547)

## 1.26.1 -- March 2021

- The cardano-submit-api now takes transactions encoded as CBOR rather than
  JSON. This reverts a change to existing behaviour for backwards compatibility.
  (#2491, #2512)
- Remove a backwards-compatibility workaround related to the optional query
  point (#2241 below) when querying the NodeLocalState. This had resulted in
  spurious notifications of disconnection in the logs. Note that as a
  consequence of this, instances of the CLI and other tools using the 1.26.1 API
  will fail to query node state from older versions of the node. (#2540)

## 1.26.0 -- March 2020
- Added a demo for the use of cardano-client. This is an API to allow writing
  programs to interact with the cardano node. (#2295, #2303)
- Removed code pertaining to the old IPC API (#2319)
- Add the ability to calculate the minimum deposit needed for a transaction to
  the API, given a value. (#2325)
- When querying the NodeLocalState, make the query point optional, and use the
  chain tip when not specified. (#2241)
- Various internal improvements and refactoring (#2349, #2458)

## 1.25.0 -- January 2020
- New IPC modules for easier interaction with the node, including support for
  all existing local state queries (#2230, #2238, #2263, #2277, #2286)
- API support for Byron era update proposals and votes (#2209, #2271)
- Make Cardano.Api the primary public module for the API.
- API support for serialising multi-asset PolicyId and AssetName (#2270)
- API for pretty-printing JSON output (#2103)
- Improved tests for Byron era legacy key formats (#2259)
- More precise error cases for tx outputs that are out of range (#2217)

  https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-node/ (#2273, #2276, #2278)
